========== Game Grid ==========
The world map grid settings is based on the Terrain Tilemap.
The TilemapRenderer component is disabled on this to hide the coloring during play.

The farthest left/right and bottom/top point which is painted on the tilemap will determine its bound.

Any tile that is not painted defaults to the 'Grassland' Terrain type which has no special properties.

Any tile that is painted blue (Water) is unwalkable.

The current scale for the map is 2x that of borders-only map
